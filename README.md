Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview:
This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains customer-level transaction data collected during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. The data is sourced from Kaggle and includes 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent, making the dataset highly imbalanced.

Business Problem:
Banking fraud poses a serious threat to financial institutions, impacting profitability, customer trust, and operational efficiency. With the rise of digital payment channels, fraudulent activities are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. Machine learning offers a proactive solution to detect and prevent such frauds, reducing manual reviews, chargebacks, and false transaction denials.

Understanding Fraud:
Credit card fraud involves unauthorized access or manipulation of cardholder information for financial gain. Common methods include:
- Skimming (duplicating magnetic strip data)
- Manipulation or alteration of genuine cards
- Creation of counterfeit cards
- Theft or loss of credit cards
- Fraudulent telemarketing

Dataset Description:
- Source: Kaggle
- Transactions: 284,807
- Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.172%)
- Features:
  - 'Time': Seconds elapsed since the first transaction
  - 'Amount': Transaction amount
  - 'Class': 1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud
  - 'V1' to 'V28': Principal components derived via PCA for confidentiality

Project Pipeline:

1. Data Understanding:
   - Load and inspect the dataset
   - Understand feature types and distributions
   - Identify relevant features for modeling

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Check for skewness and apply transformations if needed
   - No Z-scaling required due to Gaussian variables

3. Train/Test Split:
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Use k-fold cross-validation for robust validation
   - Ensure minority class is adequately represented in each fold

4. Model Building & Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Experiment with various machine learning models
   - Apply sampling techniques to address class imbalance
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Use appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
   - Focus on accurately identifying fraudulent transactions
   - Evaluate model performance on unseen data

Note:
Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, special attention must be given to techniques that enhance fraud detection accuracy without compromising the detection of legitimate transactions.
